# Statistical Analysis Description
# Overview
This repository contains the statistical analysis conducted on [machines data, sales data,seaborn inbuilt etc.]. The analysis aimed to explore the data, uncover insights, and test hypotheses to make informed decisions.
## Methods Used
Descriptive statistics
Probability distributions
Inferential statistics
Hypothesis testing
Data visualization
## Tools
Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
## Key Steps
## Data Preparation:
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately (if any).
Cleaned and preprocessed the data as needed (e.g., data type conversions, outlier removal).
## Descriptive Statistics:
Calculated summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Explored the distribution of key variables using histograms, box plots, and density plots.
## Probability Distributions:
Modeled the data using probability distributions such as Normal, Poisson, etc.
Fitted the distributions to the data and assessed goodness of fit.
## Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing:
Formulated null and alternative hypotheses based on the research questions.
Conducted appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) to evaluate the hypotheses.
Interpreted the results and drew conclusions based on the significance level.
## Data Visualization:
Created visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps) to explore relationships between variables.
Generated insights and communicated findings through informative and visually appealing plots.
# Conclusion
Hypothesis testing revealed [summarize key findings of hypothesis tests, e.g., significant differences between groups, rejection or failure to reject null hypotheses].
The analysis provided evidence to support [mention implications of hypothesis testing results, e.g., a relationship between variables, the effectiveness of a treatment].
